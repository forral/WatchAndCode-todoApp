# Watch and Code - Practical JavaScript Todo App
This is the code from the course [Watch and Code Pratical Javascript](www.watchandcode.com).

I upload this code to my GitHub account for two motives:

1. I want to build the app just by looking the requeriments but starting from the version 8 and have the possibility to repeat version 9 and 10. So I need a version control system.
2. I want to be comfortable with GitHub.
